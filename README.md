# Gps Tracking

### About

Author: Robert Howie
gps tracking app designed for the van!

### Developing

APIs and server stubs are generated via Swagger. This is for portability and integrability. 
Google cloud is used in this case, however this should be deployable to any cloud environment.

### Building

Python scripts are used to build this project. This is because local development is done a windows PC,
but in the future, CI / CD pipelines will be integrated into the git repo. Therefore an approach which
allows for multiple platforms is required.
